This script will remove all software associated with the Microsoft Store. Here is a example of the applications that will be removed:

Calculator
Calendar
Camera
Cortana
Clock
Feedback Hub
Copilot
Gamebar
Get Help
Mail
Maps

Things to consider:

After executing this script, recovery will only be possible if you have a backup. You might wonder why you can't just reinstall everything. Unfortunately (or fortunately), 
this script will also delete the Microsoft Store itself. Without a backup, you will face significant difficulties restoring the removed applications.
